What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

The question i will answer today is : "What happens when you type a URL in your browser and press Enter?" This question covers a lot of knowledge from web stack wich make it really interesting.

I will break down the workflow step by step.
Step 1: DNS Request

When you type the URL, your browser needs to find the server’s IP address. to find it it does a DNS lookup, which translates the human-readable domain name into a machine-readable IP address.

The browser checks its own cache for the IP.

If not found, it queries the operating system or a DNS resolver.

The resolver contacts authoritative DNS servers if necessary.

Step 2: Establishing a Connection

Using TCP/IP, your browser establishes a connection with the server. This involves 3 steps:

The browser sends a SYN packet.

The server replies with a SYN-ACK.

The browser completes the handshake with an ACK.

Step 3: HTTPS and SSL

If the URL uses HTTPS, the browser and server perform an SSL handshake to secure the connection. This includes:

Verifying the server’s SSL certificate.

Exchanging encryption keys to secure data.

Step 4: Load Balancer and Web Server

The request reaches a load balancer, which distributes traffic among multiple servers. The selected web server processes the request:

If it’s a static file (images, CSS file...), the web server directly responds.

For dynamic content(pages generated by a framework example : app.py), the web server forwards the request to an application server.

Step 5: Application Server and Database

The application server handles business logic and may query a database for data. The database executes the query and returns the requested information.

Step 6: Return of the Response.

The application server sends the response back through the web server and load balancer to the browser. The browser renders the content for the user.


To conclude this process shows how is the complexity behind a simple action such as typing a URL. Understanding it helps you prepare for technical interviews and gives a clearer view into how webinfrastructure works nowadays.
